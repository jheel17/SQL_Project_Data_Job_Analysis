üîçSQL queries? Check them out here: [project_sql folder](/Project_sql/)

# Background:
Currently gearing up with a Master's in Business Analytics üéì and on the hunt for that perfect Data Analyst role, I figured, why not play detective üîç in the job market first?

My quest was simple: To find out the number of remote Data Analyst jobsüíªüè†
and decoded the jigsaw of skills ‚Äî from SQL to SAS ‚Äî to discover which are the keys üîë to unlocking top salaries üí∞ and most wanted skills in job descriptions üåü

Data hails from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). Its packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. 

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were: 

1. What are the top_paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for the top paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for Data Analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills (high demand, high salary) to learn?

    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
Here are the key insights from most optimal skills (aka in high demand and associated with high average salaries): 

The top five skills, based on this criteria, are:

**Go** - Demand Count: 27, Average Salary: $115,319.89
**Confluence** - Demand Count: 11, Average Salary: $114,209.91
**Hadoop** - Demand Count: 22, Average Salary: $113,192.57
**Snowflake** - Demand Count: 37, Average Salary: $112,947.97
**Azure** - Demand Count: 34, Average Salary: $111,225.10

**Market Trends:** The data suggests a trend towards the value of skills in programming, big data processing, cloud computing, and project management within the data analysis job market. It reflects the industry's growing reliance on cloud-based solutions and big data technologies, as well as the importance of software development skills.

**High Demand but Relatively Standardized Salaries:** Python, R, and Tableau are likely to have high demand due to their critical role in data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling. However, because these skills are now standard prerequisites in the field, the supply of professionals possessing them might be relatively high, which could normalize or slightly lower the average salaries compared to more niche or emerging technologies.

**Specialized Skills:** Skills highlighted in the dataset (e.g., Go, Confluence, Hadoop, Snowflake and Azure) might be considered specialized or advanced, often requiring additional learning beyond the foundational skills. This specialization and the smaller supply of professionals with these advanced skills can drive higher average salaries.

# What I Learned Tackling SQL for the Data Job Market Project:

Jumping into SQL for this data job market project was like diving into a new adventure. Here's a more grounded recap of my journey and the skills I honed along the way:

**1. Mastering Advanced SQL Features:**
I got hands-on with some of SQL's cooler tricks, like Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, and multi-table JOINs. These tools helped me pull off more sophisticated analyses, like pinpointing top-paying jobs and sorting out which skills are worth their weight in gold.

**2. Getting Good with Grouping and Aggregation:**
Learning to aggregate and group data was key for digging into trends, like figuring out which skills are in hot demand or which jobs are paying top dollar. I used SQL's aggregation functions to boil down vast oceans of data into digestible insights.

**3. Sharpening My Filtering Skills:**
I leaned heavily on the WHERE clause to filter data for specific insights, such as isolating remote jobs or focusing on particular job titles. This helped me cut through the noise and zero in on the info I really wanted.

**4. Crafting Insights from Data:**
Turning query results into meaningful insights felt like solving a series of puzzles. This project really dialed up my ability to see beyond the numbers and understand what they're telling me about the real world.


# Conclusion:

### Insights drawn from the overall analysis: 

- **Salary Diversity:** Data Analyst roles show a broad salary range from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating varied compensation across the sector.
